# Black-Friday
The aim of this GitHub repository is to provide a statistical analysis of the transaction data and generate insights that can be used by the marketing team to target customers before Black Friday. The analysis will utilize regression, clustering, and association mining algorithms to identify patterns and trends in the data.

The project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis to assist the marketing team in targeting customers before Black Friday. The analysis will include the following components:

1. Top user identification: The analysis will identify high-value customers based on factors such as purchase frequency, total spending, and product preferences. This information can be used by the marketing team to create targeted promotions and loyalty rewards to retain these customers.

2. Product association analysis: The analysis will use association mining algorithms to identify which products are frequently purchased together. This information can be used by the marketing team to create bundle deals and cross-selling opportunities to increase sales and customer engagement.

3. Customer segmentation: The analysis will use clustering algorithms to identify customer segments based on factors such as age, gender, occupation, duration of stay in the current city, and behavior of purchases. This information can help the marketing team target specific customer groups with personalized promotions and offers.

4. Promotions and pricing strategy: The analysis will use regression algorithms to identify factors that influence customer purchase behavior, such as product categories and brands. This information can be used by the marketing team to create targeted promotions and a pricing strategy that caters to the spending behavior of different customers.

The project was conducted using R and was divided into 5 parts:

- Part 1: Data collection, imputation of missing values, and storage in MySQL. This involved collecting the transaction data and cleaning it by imputing missing values. The cleaned data was then stored in a MySQL database for further analysis.

- Part 2: Data analysis and hypothesis testing. This involved analyzing the data to identify patterns and trends and testing hypotheses to validate assumptions about the data.

- Part 3: Regression analysis using Random Forest and outlier analysis. This involved using Random Forest regression to identify factors that influence customer purchase behavior, such as product categories and brands. Outliers analysis was conducted to identify any anomalies in the data that could impact the analysis.

- Part 4: Customer segmentation using hierarchical clustering and feature engineering. This involved using hierarchical clustering algorithms to segment customers based on factors such as age, gender, occupation, duration of stay in the current city, and behavior of purchases. Feature engineering was conducted to extract relevant features from the data to improve the accuracy of the clustering such as order frequency, total purchased, and range of the purchase value.

- Part 5: Association mining using Apriori. This involved using the Apriori algorithm to identify which products are frequently purchased together.
